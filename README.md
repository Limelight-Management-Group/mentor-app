# Installation Instructions
### To run this app successfully, you must have PostgreSQL installed. You can run the brew installation command:
    $ brew install postgresql
### If this is your first time installing Postgres with Homebrew, you'll need to create a database with the following command in your terminal/ commandline:
    $ initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8
### If you're in your project directory, you can run postgres and create the project database:
    $ psql
### You will then see your username set equal to the poundsign. It should look like the following:
    waynebanks=#
### You, then need to run the following to create your 'waynes_world' database:
    CREATE DATABASE dbname;
### At this point, you should have already done a pull from the master branch and done an NPM install with the following:
    $ git pull
### then...
    $ npm install
### You then can create the webpack with the following command:
    $ npm run start-react
### You can now run your server with:
#### If you have nodemon installed you can:
    $ nodemon app 
#### If you do not, you can install or just use our start script
    $ npm run start-dev
### If this worked correctly, you should see:
    > mentor-app@1.0.0 start-dev /Users/waynebanks/Desktop/dev/mentor-app
    > nodemon app
    [nodemon] 1.11.0
    [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
    [nodemon] watching: *.*
    [nodemon] starting `node app app.js`
    the server is now running on port: 3000
